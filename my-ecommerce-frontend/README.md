# Anand's E-commerce API (Backend) - AdaptNXT Full Stack Assignment

This project implements a robust RESTful API for an e-commerce platform, built as part of the NxtWave Full Stack Development assignment. It provides core functionalities for user management, product handling, shopping cart operations, and order processing, designed with a focus on practical solutions and MERN stack principles.

## üöÄ Deployed Backend API
The backend API is deployed and live on Render:
**URL:** [https://anand-ecommerce-api.onrender.com](https://anand-ecommerce-api.onrender.com)

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure registration and login for both customers and administrators using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Bcrypt for password hashing. Role-based access control implemented for sensitive operations.
* **Product Management:** CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products, with admin-only access for creation and modification.
* **Shopping Cart Functionality:** Users can add, view, update quantities, and remove items from their personalized shopping cart.
* **Order Processing:** Authenticated users can create orders from their cart, which automatically updates product stock and clears the cart. Admin users can manage order statuses.
* **Database Integration:** Utilizes MongoDB Atlas for cloud-hosted data storage, accessed via Mongoose.
* **RESTful API Design:** Clean and well-structured API endpoints following REST principles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used (Backend)

* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
* **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js.
* **MongoDB Atlas:** Cloud-based NoSQL database.
* **Mongoose:** MongoDB object data modeling (ODM) for Node.js.
* **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** For secure authentication.
* **Bcrypt.js:** For password hashing.
* **Dotenv:** For environment variable management.
* **CORS:** Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

## üì¶ How to Test the Backend API (Using Postman)

The API is fully functional and can be tested using the provided Postman collection.

1.  **Download Postman:** If you don't have it, download Postman from [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
2.  **Import Collection:**
    * Download the Postman Collection JSON file: [anand_ecommerce_api_postman_collection.json](anand_ecommerce_api_postman_collection.json) (You will need to upload this file to the root of this GitHub repo).
    * In Postman, click "Import" -> "Upload Files" and select the downloaded JSON.
3.  **Use Deployed URL:** All requests in the collection are pre-configured to use the deployed Render API URL: `https://anand-ecommerce-api.onrender.com`.
4.  **Follow the Collection Order:** Execute requests in the order they appear (e.g., Register, Login, Create Product, Add to Cart, Create Order) to test the full flow.

## üåê Frontend Application (Separate Project)

A separate React.js frontend application, built with Vite.js, consumes this backend API to provide a user interface.

* **Frontend GitHub Repository:** [**PASTE YOUR FRONTEND GITHUB REPO LINK HERE**]
* **Deployed Frontend URL:** [**PASTE YOUR DEPLOYED FRONTEND URL HERE (from Netlify/Render)**]

### Frontend Features:
* User Registration and Login (Customer & Admin roles).
* JWT-based authentication and protected routes.
* Listing of all available products from the API.
* **Add to Cart functionality.**
* **View Cart functionality.**
* Basic dark-themed UI with responsive design.
